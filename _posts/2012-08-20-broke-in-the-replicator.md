### Broke in the Replicator

The Hacker Dojo most recently acquired a MakerBot Replicator, a 3D
printer that has dual extruders and a larger platform.  The printer
arrived last week, but this was my first chance using it.  I printed a
[simple grocery bag tool]() that I found on thingiverse.  It seemed like
a simple enough model for a first print, but I still managed to mess up
the first item that came out.

### Loose plastic caused misalignment

As you can see from the photo below, a small piece of plastic from the
extruder caused an initial deviation that snowballed into a slightly
warped product.  I stopped printing around 40% because there's no point
in wasting plastic on an imperfect product.

### Using scaffolds

My first print did not use a scaffold and had a slight warping issue, so
I decided to use the scaffolding on the second print.  Although this was
probably not necessary, it was a pleasant to see the item print without
any issues.

My final product:
